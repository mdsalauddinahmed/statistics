Linear Algebra and analysis
----------------------------
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning linear equations such as:
a1x1+⋯+anxn=b,linear maps such as:(x1,…,xn)↦a1x1+⋯+anxn, and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices

 
 
# Statistics
Statistics is a branch of mathematics that involves collecting,
analysing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides tools and
methods to understand and make sense of large amounts of data
and to draw conclusions and make decisions based on the data.
In practice, statistics is used in a wide range of fields, such as
business, economics, social sciences, medicine, and engineering. It is
used to conduct research studies, analyse market trends, evaluate
the effectiveness of treatments and interventions, and make
forecasts and predictions.

## Types of statistics

## Measure of Central Tendency
A measure of central tendency is a statistical measure that represents a typical orcentral value for a dataset. It provides a summary of the data by identifying a
single value that is most representative of the dataset as a whole.

## Mean
Mean: The mean is the sum of all values in the dataset divided by the number of
values.

## Median
Median: The median is the middle value in the dataset when the data is arranged
in order.

## Mode
Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset..

## Weighted Mean
Weighted Mean: The weighted mean is the sum of the products of each value and
its weight, divided by the sum of the weights. It is used to calculate a mean when
the values in the dataset have different importance or frequency.

## Trimmed Mean
A trimmed mean is calculated by removing a certain percentage of the
smallest and largest values from the dataset and then taking the mean
of the remaining values. The percentage of values removed is called the
trimming percentage.

## Measure of Dispersion
A measure of dispersion is a statistical measure that describes the spread or
variability of a dataset. It provides information about how the data is distributed
around the central tendency (mean, median or mode) of the dataset.

## Range
Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in
the dataset. It is a simple measure of dispersion that is easy to calculate but can be
affected by outliers.

## Variance
Variance: The variance is the average of the squared differences between each
data point and the mean. It measures the average distance of each data point
from the mean and is useful in comparing the dispersion of datasets with different
means.

## Standard Deviation

Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is
a widely used measure of dispersion that is useful in describing the shape of a
distribution.

## Coefficient of Variation

Coefficient of Variation (CV): The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation to the
mean expressed as a percentage. It is used to compare the variability of datasets
with different means and is commonly used in fields such as biology, chemistry,
and engineering.

The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that expresses the amount
of variability in a dataset relative to the mean. It is a dimensionless quantity that is
expressed as a percentage.
The formula for calculating the coefficient of variation is:

CV = (standard deviation / mean) x 100%
